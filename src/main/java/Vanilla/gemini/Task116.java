    /*
    Dropping user privileges (e.g., via setuid/setgid) is a low-level
    operating system operation that is not supported by the standard Java SE API.
    Java is designed to be platform-independent, and such operations are
    highly specific to POSIX-compliant systems (like Linux and macOS).

    To achieve this in Java, one would typically need to use the Java Native
    Interface (JNI) to call native C code that can perform the setuid/setgid
    system calls. This approach breaks the "single source code file" requirement.

    Below is a conceptual simulation. It does not actually change the OS user ID
    of the running process. It only checks the username property. To see the
    difference in output, run it normally and then run with `sudo`.
