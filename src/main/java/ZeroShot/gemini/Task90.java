         * How to test this server:
         * 1. Compile and run this Java file. The server will start listening on port 8080.
         * 2. Open a terminal/command prompt and connect using a client like telnet or netcat:
         *    `telnet localhost 8080` or `nc localhost 8080`
         * 3. Open another terminal and connect again. You now have two clients.
         * 4. Type a message in one terminal and press Enter. It should appear in the other terminal.
         * 5. Repeat with more clients (e.g., 5 test cases means 5 connected clients).
         * 6. Close a client's terminal. The server will handle the disconnection gracefully.
