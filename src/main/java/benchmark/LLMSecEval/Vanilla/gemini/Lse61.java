     * In Java, memory is managed by the Garbage Collector (GC).

     * by removing all references to it (i.e., setting them to null).
     * Attempting to do this multiple times in a loop is a harmless operation,
     * as subsequent assignments to null on an already-null reference do nothing.
     * This code demonstrates this safe behavior, which prevents double-free vulnerabilities.
